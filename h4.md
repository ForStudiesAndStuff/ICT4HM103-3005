Summary points:

* Protocol Building Blocks:

Gaining insights into the foundational elements is crucial for constructing robust communication protocols, ensuring reliability and security. Exploring the basic components and structures required to establish and maintain resilient network communication are of paramount importance as well.

* Communications Using Public-Key Cryptography:

Harnessing the power of asymmetric encryption techniques helps to facilitate secure communication with an emphasis on the significance of public and private key pairs. Establishing confidential and authenticated channels between entities through the utilization of public-key cryptography ensures no identity theft.

* Digital Signatures and Encryption:

Digital signatures is a pivotal tool ensuring the authenticity and integrity of digital messages in various communication scenarios. Integrating digital signatures with encryption methods to provide a comprehensive approach to secure communication, addresses both privacy and data integrity concerns.

* A:

The most common case of people, including myself, using public key cryptography is when we access HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) type webpages, such as online banking or shopping websites. In a nutshell, it has several steps: 

  * Secure Website Connection (Your web browser innitiates HTTPS connection);
  * Public & Private Keys (The website accessed holds a certificate with a public key which is varified by the Certificate Authority. Our browser has a list of those authorities and verifies legitimacy);
  * Secure Handshake (Browser requests said certificate & the website sends the certificate, including the key);
  * Encryption Key Exchange (Browser verifies the legitimacy of the connection. Your browser generates a symmetric encryption key for this session. It encrypts this key using the website's public key and sends it back to the website);
  * Secure Communication (The website, with its private key, decrypts the symmetric key. Now both your browser and the website have the same symmetric key for encrypting and decrypting data during the session).

* B:

All the steps were completed successfully.

* C:

An alternative to PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) for secure communication is S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions). Both PGP and S/MIME are cryptographic protocols that provide a way to secure email communication, but they have some differences, such as:

  * Key Management:
    * PGP: Decentralized web of trust. Key servers facilitate public key publishing;
    * S/MIME: Centralized PKI model & certificates issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs);
   
  * Integration with Email Clients:
    * PGP: Requires plugin or application installation;
    * S/MIME: Often natively integrated & users can manage certificates within email clients;
   
  * Standardization:
    * PGP: OpenPGP standard, RFC 4880;
    * S/MIME: Based on MIME standard, RFC 5751.
   
* D:

PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) protects against both passive eavesdropping (Eve) and malicious message modification (Mallory) through the use of encryption and digital signatures. When a user encrypts a message with PGP, it uses the recipient's public key, ensuring that only the intended recipient can decrypt and read the message, preventing eavesdropping. Additionally, PGP allows the sender to sign the message with their private key, providing a digital signature that verifies the authenticity and integrity of the message. This signature protects against malicious tampering by Mallory, as any modifications to the message would be detected during verification. The use of both encryption and digital signatures in PGP safeguards the confidentiality and integrity of the communication, thwarting the efforts of both passive eavesdroppers and active attackers.

* E:

A password manager is a tool that securely stores and manages your passwords, making it easier to maintain strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts. I personally use KeyPass on my external drive and as for demonstration, there's not much really. After obtaining the portable version and extracting it, you will be faced with below window asking to create a master password. That password will be used to access the database where the rest of your passwords will be stored.

After setting up the master password, you can start storing your login and password information. In the picture below is a preview of what you can do. It is worth noting that you have full freedom of how many bits you want your password to have, what kind of characters, how many special, numbers, etc. Overall, I strongly recommend using this tool as it can generate and store extremely difficult passwords to hack.
