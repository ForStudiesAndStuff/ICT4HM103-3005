Summary points:

* Protocol Building Blocks:

Gaining insights into the foundational elements is crucial for constructing robust communication protocols, ensuring reliability and security. Exploring the basic components and structures required to establish and maintain resilient network communication are of paramount importance as well.

* Communications Using Public-Key Cryptography:

Harnessing the power of asymmetric encryption techniques helps to facilitate secure communication with an emphasis on the significance of public and private key pairs. Establishing confidential and authenticated channels between entities through the utilization of public-key cryptography ensures no identify theft.

* Digital Signatures and Encryption:

Digital signatures is a pivotal tool ensuring the authenticity and integrity of digital messages in various communication scenarios. Integrating digital signatures with encryption methods to provide a comprehensive approach to secure communication, addresses both privacy and data integrity concerns.

* A:

The most common case of people, including myself, using public key cryptography is when we access HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) type webpages, such as online banking or shopping websites. In a nutshell, it has several steps: 

  * Secure Website Connection (your web browser innitiates HTTPS connection);
  * Public & Private Keys (the website accessed holds a certificate with a public key which is varified by the Certificate Authority. Our browser has a list of those authorities and verifies legitimacy);
  * Secure Handshake (Browser requests said certificate & the website sends the certificate, including the key);
  * Encryption Key Exchange (Browser verifies the legitimacy of the connection. Your browser generates a symmetric encryption key for this session. It encrypts this key using the website's public key and sends it back to the website);
  * Secure Communication (The website, with its private key, decrypts the symmetric key. Now both your browser and the website have the same symmetric key for encrypting and decrypting data during the session).

* B:

All the steps were complete successfully.
