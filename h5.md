# h5 Not Byzantine

Summary points:

* Introduction:

Nakamoto introduces the need for an electronic cash system that eliminates the need for a trusted third party and highlights the challenges of double-spending in digital transactions.

* Transactions:

Transactions involve transferring ownership of bitcoins from one participant to another, and each transaction is broadcasted to the entire network. The network collectively validates and orders transactions into a chronological chain.

* Timestamp Server:

A decentralized timestamp server is established by the network through a proof-of-work system, enabling participants to agree on the order of transactions. The timestamp server prevents double-spending by creating a chronological record.

* Proof-of-Work:

Proof-of-work is a consensus mechanism where participants (miners) compete to solve computationally intensive problems. The first participant to solve the problem gets the right to add a new block to the blockchain, providing security to the network.

* Network:

The Bitcoin network is a peer-to-peer network of nodes that communicate and propagate transactions. Nodes maintain a copy of the blockchain and work together to validate transactions and reach consensus on the state of the ledger.

* Incentive:

Participants are incentivized to contribute computational power and maintain the network through a reward system. Miners are rewarded with newly created bitcoins and transaction fees for successfully adding a new block to the blockchain, aligning their interests with the integrity of the system.

Question to Tero: Why specifically send an amount ending with 42?

* D:

For this excercise, I used a sample from block explorer from blockchain.com. Here are my comments:

* Block Information:
  * Block Height: The position of the block in the blockchain. It indicates how many blocks have been added before it;
  * Hash: A unique identifier for the block. It is generated using a cryptographic hash function;
  * Timestamp: The time when the block was mined and added to the blockchain, typically in Unix timestamp format;
  * Transactions: The number of transactions included in the block;
  * Size: The size of the block in bytes;
  * Difficulty: A measure of how difficult it was to find the block's hash;

* Sample Transaction Information:
  * Transaction Hash: Same as "Hash" above;
  * Size: Same as above;
  * Inputs: Details about where the bitcoins are coming from, including the previous transaction's output (UTXO) being spent;
  * Outputs: Details about where the bitcoins are going, including the recipient's address and the amount sent;
  * Fee: The transaction fee paid by the sender to miners for including the transaction in the block;
  * Confirmations: The number of blocks added to the blockchain after this block. As more blocks are added, the transaction becomes more secure and less prone to being reversed;
 
* Sample Block Explorer Fields:
  * Previous Block and Next Block: Links to the previous and next blocks in the blockchain;
  * Merkle Root: The Merkle tree root of all transactions in the block. It's a summary of all transactions, ensuring data integrity;
  * Nonce: A value used in the mining process to find a hash that satisfies the network's difficulty requirements;
  * Bits: A compressed representation of the target threshold for the block's hash;
  * Version: The version of the block format;
 
This is just an example of the analysis that can be done using an explorer. It is worth noting that if we were to use a different explorer than from blockchain.com, we would see different results, meaning different dimensions of value evaluation.

* E:

Unfortunately, I have no time for step by step screenshot demonstration. Therefore, will just write theorethical part anyway:

Creating a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet from a BIP39 mnemonic phrase involves using a wallet application that supports BIP39 and Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets. For example, Electrum used in beginning part of this excercise. On a high level, if the following steps are followed, you can succeed in created necessary environment:

  * Install Electrum: Download Electrum by using a search engine;
  * Simulate Fresh Start: You will have to simulate a fresh start. For that, use the following command: "'mv -nv ~/.electrum/ ~/DIS-electrum'";
  * Open electrum;
  * Choose Standard Wallet;
  * Choose "I already have a seed". This step is important as you need to refer to your already exhisting seed... Although, I am not entirely sure if pure start from fresh approach can be used or not;
  * Enter BIP39 Mnemonic: This is the series of phrases you got while generating your seed. Inputint these phrases correctly will grant you the access to your existing seed;
  * Password setup & Derivation path: These two are optional but you are welcome to create them but for the love of god, please do not use "Password123" as password :);
  * Complete setup & Regenerate wallet: Thanks to fresh start and mnemonic phrase, your hierarchical deterministic wallet has been regenerated using the BIP39 mnemonic phrase. You should now see your wallet's balance and transaction history.

NOTE: Mnemonic phrase is of utmost importance here. Think of it as a master and a unique key to your crypto wallet. If you loose it and end up also somehow ruining your existing wallet environment, good luck restoring it. I also do not recommend keeping your mnemonic phrase on the same computer where your wallet is and NEVER, EVER show it to anyone as anyone knowing your phrase can literally copy paste the phrases and get access to your wallet.
