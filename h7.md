# h7 Hacker Feed

For this task Disobey 2020 was chosen as I admire Mikko Hypp√∂nen. Summary points below:

* It was eye opening to realise that despite the fact that US leads (and quite frankly holds the monopoly) in the market of CPUs, Operating Systems, both PC and mobile, that it counts only for a fraction of internet users. Interesting realisation that the rest of the world relise on them;
* Apple having more than 1.5 billion active devices is mind boggling, even more than Microsoft. Just shows how much marketshare that tech giant is owning and if we combine both, we are at 3+ billion active devices;
* Scary to realise how dependant we are on electricity. How limited our lives will become if we are deprived of it even for a week. In connection to this, a parallel can be made with internet. We are becoming reliant on that as well;
* Learnt about the existence of Yevgeniy Nikulin and what he has done (hacked into LinkedIN and stole userbase data). It is worth noting that in October 2016, he was arrested in the Czech Republic at the request of the United States, where he was charged with hacking into the systems of several major U.S. tech companies, including LinkedIn, Dropbox, and Formspring. Both Russia and US sought to extradite him but in 2018, Czech Republic approved the request from the States;
* Learnt about the existence of Igor Turashev and what he has done (enormous malware dump on infected machines... and that he likes to do donuts in Moscow in front of Ministry of Justice building. What a guy :D);
* Learnt about what happened between Jeff Bezos & Mohammed bin Salman (how Mohammed sent a WhatsApp message to Bezos which took over his phone). Jesus, sounds like a movie plot indeed!;
* Learnt about what happened to Maersk (on how 90% of their ADs got wiped in less than 10 minutes by "NotPetya" originally disguissed as ransomware/malware but later identified as directed attack with a purpose of damage and distruption);
* How machine learning is used in BEC attacks. Imagine getting a call from your "Boss" whose voice is simulated by deep fake. What are the chances you will figure that out unless the request is absolutely bizzare?;
* We should indeed stop blaming the users for mistakes because then they become defensive and that might distort the reality. They will keep hiding what mistakes did they do. Instead, we should provide support, education and change the approach from punishing to supportive;
* "When security fails, it looks bad. When security works, nothing happens". Perfectly put by Mikko.;
