# h2 Crown Jewels and Bad Guys

3rd Industrial Revolution, or more commonly known as Digital Revolution has created amazing opportunities and propelled humanity like no other revolution. Life has become digital in a blink of an eye and owning a cell phone nowadays which has more computing power than IBM's first computer, is a common occurance. However, not everything is unicorn and rainbows. Digital Transformation has created new vectors of attack for criminals, or in this case, cyber criminals. If you were to mention this term several decades ago, you'd be laughed at but nowadays it is a real threat. Despite Digital Transformation bringing in absurd increase in productivity and improvement in overall quality of life, it came with one inherent caveat, vulnerability. The tools are as good as they are built but in case of a digital tool, it heavily relies on external tool which is designed to provide security. It is well recognized fact that more damage to a countries' economy can be done by concentrated and powerful cyber attack on its infrustructure than declaring war with conventional weaponry.

After reading the literature from Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains and Shostack 2014: Chapter 1 - Dive In and Threat Model, I can draw the following parallels with my work:

* Understanding the Intrusion Kill Chain:

In the paper, the concept of the intrusion kill chain is discussed, which breaks down the stages of a cyber attack, from initial reconnaissance to data exfiltration. This knowledge can be directly applied to my work in financial system implementations, as it helps me understand the typical stages of an attack and how an attacker might target my systems.

Example: By recognizing the stages of an intrusion kill chain, I can proactively design security measures and controls that specifically address each stage, making it more challenging for attackers to progress through the chain.

* Intelligence-Driven Defense:

Further emphasize is given to the importance of intelligence-driven defense, which involves actively collecting and analyzing information about cyber adversaries and their tactics. This is highly relevant to my work because financial systems are often targeted by skilled attackers seeking to exploit vulnerabilities.

Example: By adopting intelligence-driven defense, I can stay informed about the latest threats and attack techniques and adapt my cybersecurity strategies accordingly. This ensures that I am better prepared to defend against evolving attack vectors.

* API and AI Security:

Given that my work involves me extensively with APIs and AI, it's crucial to consider how these technologies can introduce new attack vectors. The paper doesn't specifically address these technologies, but in my opinion the principles of understanding adversary tactics and kill chains can be applied to protect my APIs and AI systems

Example: I can use the knowledge gained from the paper to assess potential vulnerabilities in my API and AI implementations. By analyzing how attackers might exploit these technologies and identifying the stages of intrusion, I can develop specific security measures to safeguard these areas.

* Real-life Case:

In 2017, Equifax, a major credit reporting agency, experienced a significant data breach that exposed sensitive financial information of millions of consumers. This breach was a real-life example of the concepts discussed in the paper. Attackers exploited vulnerabilities at various stages of the intrusion kill chain, including gaining initial access, moving laterally within the network, and exfiltrating sensitive data. The Equifax breach demonstrated the importance of understanding and defending against intrusion kill chains, as well as the need for intelligence-driven defense in the financial sector.

## Boogieman case

### Imaginary Company: CryptoKings

CryptoKings is an imaginary company that specializes in providing blockchain-based security solutions for individuals and organizations. The company offers services such as secure digital asset storage, decentralized identity management, and secure smart contracts.

4. Did we do a good job?
 
To evaluate the effectiveness of our security measures, we will regularly conduct security audits, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments. We will also monitor for security incidents and track metrics such as unauthorized access attempts, successful breaches, and response times. Periodic reviews and updates of our threat model will ensure that we adapt to new threats and challenges as they arise.

## Incident analysis:

I will be using the same company and the same incident I mentioned above, the Equifax data breach of 2017:

1. Reconnaissance:

  * Cyber Kill Chain: The attackers most likely began with reconnaissance as that is the first step in the kill chain, gathering information about Equifax's systems, network infrastructure, and potential vulnerabilities.
  * MITRE ATT&CK: Techniques used during this stage may include "Active Scanning" to collect information about Equifax's systems and personnel.

2. Weaponization:

  * Cyber Kill Chain: In this stage, the attackers could have created malicious tools or crafted phishing emails that compromised Equifax's systems or employees (Looking at you BEC!).
  * MITRE ATT&CK: Is it possible some sort of a "Malware" was utilized which is pretty much a leaky faucet in your kitchen constantly leaking water down the drain but in this case water is information, faucet your database and drain the attackers.

3. Delivery:

  * Cyber Kill Chain: I suspect the attackers delivered the bomb through a phishing attack or by exploiting a vulnerability in Equifax's systems, if it was discovered in stage 1.
  * MITRE ATT&CK: This stage might involve techniques such as "Spearphishing Attachment" or "Spearphishing Link" to deliver malicious content. Think of a link that you should ABSOLUTELY NOT CLICK!

4. Exploitation:

  * Cyber Kill Chain: At this point, the attackers exploited a vulnerability to gain access to Equifax's systems. I do not know how this was achieved though and I could not find it being disclosed.
  * MITRE ATT&CK: Techniques such as "Exploit Public-Facing Application" or "Exploitation for Privilege Escalation" could be relevant here?

5. Installation:

  * Cyber Kill Chain: Once inside Equifax's systems, the attackers likely installed malware or established a persistent presence to maintain control... OR it is also possible they kept idle and were monitoring the situation, waiting for a perfect vector to attack.
  * MITRE ATT&CK: If I ware bad guys here, I would definitely use "Remote Desktop Protocol".

6. Command and Control:

  * Cyber Kill Chain: Now this is where it gets awesome (well, not for the company sadly). I think in this stage the attackers established a control infrastructure to communicate with the compromised systems, allowing them to exfiltrate data and maintain command.
  * MITRE ATT&CK: Techniques here include "Remote File Copy" for example where you pretty much download the necessary information.

7. Actions on Objectives:

  * Cyber Kill Chain: And we are at the final stage. At this point, the attackers have control of the system they desire and likely proceeded extracting whatever they wanted.
  * MITRE ATT&CK: Techniques might involve "Data Exfiltration" to steal and transmit the data.

8. Conclussion:

The Equifax breach was a significant incident that highlights the importance of addressing vulnerabilities and implementing strong security measures at every stage of the Cyber Kill Chain to prevent such breaches

## Starting a lab

Not much to report here on. I followed the guide (except I did not do pushups while waiting for it to install but instead had a chocolate :D) + used my previous knowledge. The OS is Win 11.

## Voluntary bonus

There are multitude of security fundamentals: Confidentiality, Data protection, Risk management, Security policies, Security awareness, Security mechanisms etc. If I were to teach any of these topics, I think I would actually teach 2FA (2 Factor Authorization) which belongs to security mechanisms category I believe. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a specific security control or technology that can be part of a broader security strategy outlined in security policies. It makes it extremely difficult for an attacker to gain access to a platform with your credentials. Even if they manage to steal your login AND password, once entered, it will trigger 2FA on your phone for example and then if you have at least two brain cells you won't click "Allow" :D
