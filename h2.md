# h2 Crown Jewels and Bad Guys

3rd Industrial Revolution, or more commonly known Digital Revolution has created amazing opportunities and propelled humanity like no other revolution. Life has become digital in a blink of an eye and owning a cell phone nowadays which has more computing power than IBM's first computer, is a common occurance. However, not everything is unicorn and rainbows. Digital Transformation has created new vectors of attack for criminals, or in this case, cyber criminals. If you were to mention this terms several decades ago, you'd be laughed at but nowadays it is a real threat. Despite Digital Transformation bringing in absurd increase in productivbity and improvement in overall quality of life, it came with one inherent caviat, vulnerability. The tools are as good as they are built but in case of a digital tool, it heavily relies on external tool which is design to provide security. It is well recognized fact that more damage to a countries economy can be done by concentrated and powerful cyber attack on its infrustructure than declaring war with conventional weaponry.

After reading the literature from Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains and Shostack 2014: Chapter 1 - Dive In and Threat Model, I can draw the following parallels with my work:

* Understanding the Intrusion Kill Chain:

In the paper, the concept of the intrusion kill chain is discussed, which breaks down the stages of a cyber attack, from initial reconnaissance to data exfiltration. This knowledge can be directly applied to my work in financial system implementations, as it helps me understand the typical stages of an attack and how an attacker might target my systems.

Example: By recognizing the stages of an intrusion kill chain, I can proactively design security measures and controls that specifically address each stage, making it more challenging for attackers to progress through the chain.

* Intelligence-Driven Defense:

Further emphasize is given to the importance of intelligence-driven defense, which involves actively collecting and analyzing information about cyber adversaries and their tactics. This is highly relevant to my work because financial systems are often targeted by skilled attackers seeking to exploit vulnerabilities.

Example: By adopting intelligence-driven defense, I can stay informed about the latest threats and attack techniques and adapt my cybersecurity strategies accordingly. This ensures that I am better prepared to defend against evolving attack vectors.

* API and AI Security:

Given that my work involves me extensively with APIs and AI, it's crucial to consider how these technologies can introduce new attack vectors. The paper doesn't specifically address these technologies, but in my opinion the principles of understanding adversary tactics and kill chains can be applied to protect my APIs and AI systems

Example: I can use the knowledge gained from the paper to assess potential vulnerabilities in my API and AI implementations. By analyzing how attackers might exploit these technologies and identifying the stages of intrusion, I can develop specific security measures to safeguard these areas.

* Real-life Case Illustration:

In 2017, Equifax, a major credit reporting agency, experienced a significant data breach that exposed sensitive financial information of millions of consumers. This breach was a real-life example of the concepts discussed in the paper. Attackers exploited vulnerabilities at various stages of the intrusion kill chain, including gaining initial access, moving laterally within the network, and exfiltrating sensitive data. The Equifax breach demonstrated the importance of understanding and defending against intrusion kill chains, as well as the need for intelligence-driven defense in the financial sector.

## Boogieman case:

### Imaginary Company: CryptoKings.Inc

CryptoGuardians Inc. is an imaginary company that specializes in providing blockchain-based security solutions for individuals and organizations. The company offers services such as secure digital asset storage, decentralized identity management, and secure smart contracts.

#### Threat Model for CryptoGuardians Inc:

* 1. What are we building?:

We are building a blockchain security company, focused on providing secure solutions for digital asset management, identity verification, and smart contracts on blockchain networks. Our products include a decentralized digital wallet, a blockchain identity platform, and a secure smart contract development framework.

* 2. What could go wrong?:

** Unauthorized Access:

*** Threat: Unauthorized users gaining access to digital wallets or identity platforms.

*** Mitigation: Strong authentication methods, encryption, and continuous monitoring of access.

** Data Breach:

*** Threat: Theft or exposure of sensitive user data.

*** Mitigation: Data encryption, access controls, regular security audits.

** Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:

*** Threat: Bugs or vulnerabilities in smart contracts leading to financial losses.

*** Mitigation: Extensive code review, testing, and audit processes.

** 51% Attack:

*** Threat: An attacker gaining control of over 50% of the blockchain network's mining power.

*** Mitigation: Decentralization, consensus mechanisms, and monitoring for unusual mining activity.

** Phishing Attacks:

*** Threat: Users falling victim to phishing attacks leading to the loss of digital assets.

*** Mitigation: User education, anti-phishing measures, and email authentication.

** Regulatory Compliance:

*** Threat: Non-compliance with emerging blockchain and cryptocurrency regulations.

*** Mitigation: Stay informed, establish legal teams, and adhere to evolving regulations.

* 3. What are we doing about it?
 
** Access Control:

*** Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and strong password policies.

*** Employ robust session management to protect user sessions.

** Data Protection:

*** Encrypt sensitive user data at rest and in transit.

*** Restrict access to data based on role and necessity.

** Smart Contract Development:

*** Follow best practices for secure smart contract development.

*** Perform code audits and testing to identify vulnerabilities.

** Network Security:

*** Utilize decentralized networks with strong consensus algorithms.

*** Monitor for unusual network activity and maintain redundancy.

** User Education:

*** Conduct regular user training on identifying phishing attempts.

*** Implement anti-phishing measures in user interfaces.

** Compliance:

*** Collaborate with legal experts to ensure adherence to relevant regulations.

*** Stay informed about evolving regulations and adapt policies as needed.

* 4. Did we do a good job?:
 
To evaluate the effectiveness of our security measures, we will regularly conduct security audits, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments. We will also monitor for security incidents and track metrics such as unauthorized access attempts, successful breaches, and response times. Periodic reviews and updates of our threat model will ensure that we adapt to new threats and challenges as they arise.
