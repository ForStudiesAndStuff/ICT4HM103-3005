# h3 Hashes

Summary points:

* One-way Functions: A one-way function is a mathematical function that is easy to compute in one direction but difficult to reverse. Given the output of the function, it should be computationally infeasible to determine the input. This property is crucial in various cryptographic applications, such as password hashing.

* One-way Hash Functions: A one-way hash function is a specific type of one-way function that takes an input (or 'message') and produces a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hash value. The key characteristic is that it should be computationally infeasible to reconstruct the original input from its hash value. These functions are commonly used in cybersecurity for tasks like storing passwords securely.

These approaches can be applied in numerous ways, such as:

* Password Hashing;
* Digital Signatures;
* Data Integrity;
* Cryptographic Salting.

Furthermore, about Hashcat:

* Cracking Passwords with Hashcat:

Systems store password hashes, not the original passwords, using one-way hash functions. Hashcat, a hash-cracking program, can be used to attempt dictionary attacks on password hashes. The process involves installing Hashcat, identifying the hash type, and using a dictionary file to crack the password.

* Hashcat Installation and Usage:

Hashcat and necessary applications on Debian 11 Bullseye can be installed using the command line. Obtain a large dictionary file (e.g., Rockyou) and use it to attempt the password cracking process with Hashcat. The article provides commands for installing, setting up, and running Hashcat to crack a sample MD5 hash.

* Cracking Process and Results:

The article demonstrates the steps to crack a specific MD5 hash, revealing the password "summer." Hashcat output includes information about the cracked hash, hash type (MD5), and the speed of the cracking attempt. Suggestions for optimizing Hashcat's performance, such as running it on real hardware with GPU support, are provided.

Later, about Command Line Basics:

* Command Line Basics:

The command line in Linux and BSD is a time-tested, fast, and expressive tool for system navigation and automation. Basic commands like 'pwd' (print working directory) and 'ls' (list files) help users navigate directories and view file content. File manipulation commands such as 'mv' (move), 'cp' (copy), and 'rm' (remove) are demonstrated for effective file and directory management.

* SSH Remote Control:

Securely access remote machines using the 'ssh' command, providing a command-line interface to the remote system. The 'scp' command enables secure file transfer between local and remote machines. Commands for exiting a remote shell and securely copying folders to remote locations are outlined.

* Help, History, and Guessing:

Access command manuals using 'man' and built-in help with '--help' or '-h' options. Utilize tab completion for efficient command-line input and to avoid typos. Navigate command history with arrow keys, and access a searchable history with 'ctrl-R (^R)'.

* A:

It took me 9 tries by trial and error to get a hash starting with a 0. The answer is this: "echo -n 'Terod' | sha256sum". The predecessors were:

* Tero1;
* Tero2;
* Tero3;
* Tero4;
* Tero5;
* Teroa;
* Terob;
* Teroc;
* Terod (The winner hash): 04054d3aeee1ba7b397eb6c9bd734c0be473b99573fae51b3e139c9d7e28b167

Regarding connection with Bitcoin, in my opinion the paralel that can be drawn is that in Bitcoin mining, miners compete to find a hash with a specific number of leading zeros, known as proof-of-work, adding a new block to the blockchain and earning rewards. This process ensures the security and integrity of the Bitcoin network.

* B:

Cryptographic hash functions are designed to be sensitive to input changes, and even a small alteration in the input should produce a substantially different hash output. Therefore, changing even a single letter in .txt file name results in vastly different hash.

* C:

Cracked hash "21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3" returned the value of "admin".

* D:

Cracked hash "f2477a144dff4f216ab81f2ac3e3207d" returned the value of "monkey". NOTE: This required using Hashcat Mode 1000 as analysis of the hash indicated it is requiring m 1000.

* E:

Cracked hash "'$2y$18$axMtQ4N8j/NQVItQJed9uORfsUK667RAWfycwFMtDBD6zAo1Se2eu'" returned the value of "12345". NOTE: This required using Hashcat mode 3200 as analysis of the hash indicated it is requiring m 3200.

# (Update 1.1; 16.11.2023):

* Removed "optional" answer from task A (print a hash starting with a 0) which involved manipulating the assignment question using "print" command. Left only the correct answer for clarity.
* Revised answer to E as after the lesson I understood that I needed to add quotation marks to the hash.

# (Update 1.2; 20.11.2023):

* Added new reference.
